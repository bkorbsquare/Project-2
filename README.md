# Project 2

## Description

- This code displays a chat application.
- I wanted to create a private chat application for my group and I.
- We coded using Javascript, Express, Mysql, Handlebars, and Socket io under the MVC paradigm.
- Given more time we would include additional style elements and features on the chat page like an emoji bar & a light/dark switch.
